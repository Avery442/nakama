# Commit Message Style

- Subject should be 50 characters or less
- Keep your commit messages concise and descriptive.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", "Fix bug").
- Start with a capital letter and do not end with a period.
- Reference related issues or pull requests when applicable (e.g., "Fix #123").
- Separate subject from body with a blank line if a detailed explanation is needed.
- Focus on what and why, not how.
